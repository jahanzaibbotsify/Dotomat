    "title": "AI Content Pipeline",
    "short": "A workflow that triggers daily, generates blog content using AI models, publishes to WordPress and Twitter, and logs data to Google Sheets.",
    "description": "The AI Content Pipeline is an automated system designed to streamline the process of content creation and distribution. It begins with a daily trigger that initiates the workflow, ensuring fresh content is generated and published at regular intervals. The first step involves an HTTP request to a Google service, likely fetching data or instructions from sources like Google Docs or Sheets. This data serves as the foundation for the next stage, where an AI model, possibly DeepSeek Chat or another large language model, processes the input to generate a blog post. The generated content is tailored to meet specific requirements, ensuring relevance and quality. \n\nOnce the blog post is ready, the system automatically publishes it to a WordPress site using a predefined template or formatting. This step eliminates the need for manual uploading, saving time and reducing errors. Simultaneously, the pipeline creates a tweet to promote the blog post on Twitter, helping to drive traffic and engagement. The tweet may include a summary, key points, or a direct link to the post, depending on the configured settings. \n\nTo maintain transparency and track performance, the pipeline logs all activities, such as publication status or engagement metrics, into a Google Sheet. This provides a centralized record for analysis and future optimizations. The use of DeepSeek Chat as the primary AI model highlights its role in generating coherent and contextually appropriate content. The entire workflow is designed to operate seamlessly, minimizing human intervention while maximizing efficiency. This makes it ideal for bloggers, marketers, or businesses looking to maintain a consistent online presence with minimal effort. The pipeline can be further customized to include additional platforms or features, such as SEO enhancements or multi-channel distribution, depending on specific needs.",

    "title": "Summeries RSS Feed",
    "short": "Automatically summarizes RSS feed content using AI and emails the digest to subscribers.",
    "description": "The workflow begins when manually triggered (or potentially scheduled) to fetch the latest updates from a specified RSS feed. It sends the full text of each feed item to an AI summarization model (like OpenAI) which condenses the content while preserving key information. The generated summaries are then compiled into a digest format and distributed via email to subscribers. This provides recipients with concise, value-packed updates without overwhelming them with full articles. The solution is ideal for curating news digests, industry updates, or content roundups while saving hours of manual reading and summarization work. The automated process ensures timely delivery of summarized knowledge with minimal effort.",

    "short": "Analyzes customer feedback, alerts managers for urgent issues, assigns available agents, and logs resolved tickets.",
    "description": "This workflow automates the handling of incoming customer support tickets by integrating sentiment analysis, manager alerts, agent assignment, and logging. When a new ticket arrives via a webhook, the system first extracts the ticket details and performs sentiment analysis using an API. If the sentiment is negative, the workflow immediately notifies a manager via email and Slack to ensure prompt attention to critical issues. \n\nNext, the system checks agent availability to assign the ticket to the most suitable representative, optimizing response times. Once assigned, the ticket details are logged into Artable, a project management or ticketing tool, for tracking and resolution. This end-to-end automation improves efficiency, prioritizes high-priority complaints, and ensures accountability by documenting each step. The workflow is ideal for customer support teams aiming to enhance responsiveness and maintain organized records.",
